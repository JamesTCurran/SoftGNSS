# Analysis
Various analysis scripts

getBits 	turns valid bits into a pretty plot aligned by subframe.

Proposed:
lookAtBits	future tool to dump out bits from invalid satellites to interrogate (likely pointless because polarity flips)
Other raw data outputs like 
 - analysis plots (doppler v. codephase)
 - frames 4/5, 
 - extracting GPS week/time with link to IGS products
 - etc.
